"""
Export Employee's TODO List to CSV

This Python script fetches information about an employee's TODO list progress from a REST API and exports it to a CSV file. It utilizes the JSONPlaceholder API for data retrieval.

Usage:
    python3 1-export_to_CSV.py EMPLOYEE_ID

    - EMPLOYEE_ID (int): The ID of the employee for whom you want to export the TODO list.

The script fetches employee data and their TODO list from the API, formats it, and exports it to a CSV file with the following format:
"USER_ID","USERNAME","TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS","TASK_TITLE"

The CSV file is named USER_ID.csv, where USER_ID is the ID of the employee.

Example:
    To export the TODO list for employee with ID 2:
    $ python3 1-export_to_CSV.py 2

    This will create a file named "2.csv" containing the employee's TODO list data.
