"""
4-base_geometry.py - A Python module defining the BaseGeometry class.

This module defines the `BaseGeometry` class, which serves as an empty base class with no attributes or methods. It provides a foundation for building more complex classes and includes a public instance method `area()` that raises an exception when called.

Classes:
    BaseGeometry:
        An empty base class with no attributes or methods. It serves as a foundation for other classes to inherit from.

Usage:
    import 4-base_geometry

    class DerivedClass(4-base_geometry.BaseGeometry):
        pass

    obj = DerivedClass()
    try:
        print(obj.area())
    except Exception as e:
        print("[{}] {}".format(e.__class__.__name__, e))  # Output: [Exception] area() is not implemented

Note:
    - This module does not require any external module imports.
    - The `BaseGeometry` class is designed to be a simple base class with no functionality.
    - It can be subclassed to create more complex classes that build upon its foundation.
    - The `area()` method raises an exception with the message "area() is not implemented".
    - Derived classes should implement their own version of the `area()` method to calculate the area based on their specific geometric properties.
