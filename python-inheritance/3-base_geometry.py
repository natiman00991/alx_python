"""
3-base_geometry.py - A Python module defining an empty class BaseGeometry.

This module defines the `BaseGeometry` class, which serves as a base class with no attributes or methods. It allows other classes to inherit from it and provides a foundation for building more complex classes.

Classes:
    BaseGeometry:
        An empty base class with no attributes or methods. It serves as a foundation for other classes to inherit from.

Usage:
    import 3-base_geometry

    class DerivedClass(3-base_geometry.BaseGeometry):
        pass

    obj = DerivedClass()
    print(isinstance(obj, 3-base_geometry.BaseGeometry))  # Output: True
    print(dir(obj))  # Output: ['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__']

Note:
    - This module does not require any external module imports.
    - The `BaseGeometry` class is designed to be a simple base class with no functionality.
    - It can be subclassed to create more complex classes that build upon its foundation.
